## Notes

Due to time constraints I was only able to make it to the company details page.  When run locally there is some very basic styling, but because I was nearing the end of the deadline, I was not able to figure out why the styling did not work in the deployment.  

The technique I chose to use was to use React as the view layer of a rails app.  I have never done this before, and it seemed pretty straight forward, so I gave it a shot.  

The result was that I spent a lot of time messing about with a technique I had never tried before, and I was not able to get nearly as far as I would have if I had just kept the Api and the front end separate.  

I did however, learn quite a bit from the challenges I encountered, so not a total loss!  Thanks for you time and patience and I hope you have some fun poking around the repo.
